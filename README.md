# oop_game-v2

Phrase Hunter utilizes JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programmings) to
create a word guessing game. A Game class is created to manage the game's
functionality and a Phrase class is used to help create an array of objects.

A phrase is chosen at random and the user is able to guess letters that might
appear in that phrase by either clicking the on-screen keyboard or typing on
their computer's keyboard. If the user guesses correctly, all instances of that
letter appear in the phrase. If the user guesses incorrectly, they lose a life.
The user starts out with 5 lives. The game ends when the user correctly guesses
all of the letters in the phrase (Win!) or when the user runs out of lives (loss).

The following CSS changes were made to give this project a more personal touch:<br>
-Modified the overlay background colors for start, win, and lose screens.<br>
-Modified the background color of keys.<br>
-Modified the font used throughout.<br>
-Added shadowing to the h2 text.
